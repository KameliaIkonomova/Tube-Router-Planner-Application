Designing, developing and testing a journey planner model for the London Underground System (Tube Router Planner Application).

The prime object of the “Tube Router Planner Application” is to create a full-fledged app which could
help a user to find the shortest path for his journey. The user not only can find the shortest path to
get their preferred station, but also have the total journey time and the number of stations that will
face in his journey. Therefore, the user has the facilities to find many stations of any tube line.
The project is developed in Phyton programming language by using Pycharm.
The main screen is simple with some option on what the app offer to the user. Colours are simple
with sky blue on background, white on the text box.
The design of the app is confirmative to the user. The main screen of the app output illustrates the
app to the user. This is user friendly model.
The buttons on the app, was designed to show the user the selection they are about to make (Okay
button and Quit button).
The okay button is to show the shortest travel path and total journey time of the stations given by
the user. The quit button is to exit the 1st window.
The creation of the app and code its completion was fulfilled on time. I believe this was by the use of
planning and the team contributions, these aided us by giving us a clear set if task to complete and
the date said task should be completed by. 

Outputs:
The first screen has a user interface for the user to enter the name of the station he is coming from
(1) and the station he wants to go (2). The last option (3) is to select the time that the user wants to
travel

If the user completes the data asked to him it will show like the picture below

After that, if the user clicks on okay. It will show all the stations that he will travel for going to his
destination. It will show which line the user needs to use and it will show the total journey time as
well. There is a back button at the bottom which destroys the 2nd screen and will take the user back
to the 1st screen.
